EA Sports FIFA 21 is a popular video game that simulates soccer matches. Often, data collected from this game might be messy, containing inconsistencies, missing values, and various formatting issues. In this project, I will focus on cleaning and preparing messy FIFA 21 data for analysis using Python and Pandas, Numpy.

The Bike Stores project aims to determine the revenue growth trend over the years by analyzing various factors. Using SSMS to query the data and export the dataset, Tableau is then utilized to create charts that provide valuable insights into top customers and revenue per salesperson.
