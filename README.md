EA Sports FIFA 21 is a popular video game that simulates soccer matches. Often, the data collected from this game can be messy, contain inconsistencies, lack values, and many formatting problems.  
In this project, I will focus on cleaning up and preparing messy FIFA 21 data for analysis.  
<b>Tools Used:</b> Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebook.
