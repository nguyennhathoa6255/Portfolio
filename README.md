This project develops a chatbot that interprets natural language queries, generates SQL queries, and fetches results from a SQL database in an intuitive, user-friendly way. It leverages the Gemini-Pro model and integrates with the Streamlit GUI for an enhanced interactive experience. [Chatbot](https://chatbot-mysql-gemini.streamlit.app/?embed_options=light_theme)  
<b>Tools Used:</b> MySQL, LangChain, Streamlit, Railway

The Bike Stores project aims to determine the revenue growth trend over the years by analyzing various factors. Using Microsoft SQL Server to query the data and export the dataset, Tableau is then utilized to create charts that provide valuable insights into top customers and revenue per salesperson.

EA Sports FIFA 21 is a popular video game that simulates soccer matches. Often, the data collected from this game can be messy, contain inconsistencies, lack values, and many formatting problems.  
In this project, I will focus on cleaning up and preparing messy FIFA 21 data for analysis.  
<b>Tools Used:</b> Python (Pandas, Numpy), Jupyter Notebook.
